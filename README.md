# mm4cc-pkg

Debian packages for setting up systems according to my requirements.

To set up your computer with `mm4cc-*` packages, run this in a command line:

```bash
curl https://ppa.maddiem4.cc/setup-ppa.sh | sh
```

Packages currently provided:

 * `obsidian` - hosted versions of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Debian package
 * `mm4cc-devtools` - various programming tools that I need regularly
 * `glu` - [A tutorial to directory converter](https://github.com/MaddieM4/glu)
