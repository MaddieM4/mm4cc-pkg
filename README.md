# Maddie's Package Hosting

Debian packages for setting up systems according to my requirements.

To set up your computer with `mm4cc-*` packages, run this in a command line:

```bash
curl https://ppa.maddiem4.cc/setup-ppa.sh | sh
```

Packages currently provided:

 * `mm4cc-base` - (Installed by setup) configures apt for installing pkgs like `1password-cli` and `docker-ce`
 * `mm4cc-devtools` - various programming tools that I need regularly
 * `mm4cc-dotfiles` - [personal configuration tooling](https://github.com/MaddieM4/dotfiles)
 * `mm4cc-desktop` - set up LXQt and i3 quickly (best paired with dotfiles config)
 * `glu` - [A tutorial to directory converter](https://github.com/MaddieM4/glu)
 * `obsidian` - hosted versions of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Debian package
